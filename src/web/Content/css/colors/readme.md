# Color Schemes
The editor can change the color scheme for the site on the site settings properties on the start page.

If default is selected, the colors in the main `styles.css` file is used, not the ones in the `color-default.css`, this file is just a reference file for completeness. 

The schemes are generated from the less files under `/content/less/colors/`
